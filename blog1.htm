                    People around the world face violence and inequality—and sometimes torture, even execution—because of who they love, how they look, or who they are. Sexual orientation and gender identity are integral aspects of our selves and should never lead to discrimination or abuse. Human Rights Watch works for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender peoples' rights, and with activists representing a multiplicity of identities and issues. We document and expose abuses based on sexual orientation and gender identity worldwide, including torture, killing and executions, arrests under unjust laws, unequal treatment, censorship, medical abuses, discrimination in health and jobs and housing, domestic violence, abuses against children, and denial of family rights and recognition. We advocate for laws and policies that will protect everyone’s dignity. We work for a world where all people can enjoy their rights fully.
                    With more than 5.5 million LGBTQ individuals living in the United States, it’s important to recognize not only our progress in furthering equality efforts, but also the barriers LGBTQ people still face in fair and equal access to employment, housing, healthcare, and public accommodation.
</p><p>
According to the Center for American Progress, as many as 1 in 4 LGBTQ individuals in the U.S. reported experiencing some form of discrimination in 2016.

While there exist a number of nondiscrimination laws on the federal, state, and local levels that protect people from discrimination on the basis of characteristics such as age, sex, or national origin—until recently, federal law did not protect individuals from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. That changed in June 2020 with the Supreme Court’s landmark ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County, where the Court ruled that the provision of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that protects employees from sex discrimination also extends to the protection of employees based on their gender identity and sexual orientation. However, it is important to note that this ruling only prohibits such discrimination in the employment context – it does not offer protection under this law to such individuals on in other areas such as housing.

This guide offers an important overview on the types of discrimination LGBTQ individuals face in the United States and their legal protections. 

What Is Discrimination?
The legal definition of discrimination is the unequal treatment of persons on the basis of an identifying characteristic.

Discrimination can refer to any sort of act or behavior that distinguishes or singles out individuals on account of factors such as age, sex, race, national origin, sexual orientation, and gender identity. This can include revoking or extending preferential treatment.

The primary forms of discrimination discussed in reference to the LGBTQ population are those based on sexual orientation and gender identity. However, LGBTQ individuals can also face discrimination as a result of other identifiers, such as their skin color, national origin, or abilities.
</p><p>
Types Of Discrimination
Discrimination can come in many forms and occur in a variety of settings. From the workplace, to your doctor’s office, to the store you frequent for groceries—any setting that involves contact with another person can become a site of discrimination.

46 percent of LGBTQ workers are closeted in the workplace.
23 percent of transgender individuals in a 2011 survey reported experiencing “catastrophic discrimination,” which is defined as three or more life-disrupting events.
LGBTQ immigrants face unique barriers in gaining access to adequate healthcare and legal protections against federal and employment discrimination.
One in five survivors of anti-LGBTQ violence in the U.S. are undocumented LGBTQ immigrants.
68.5 percent of LGBTQ respondents in a 2017 survey who had experienced discrimination reported a negative impact on their psychological wellbeing.
56.6 percent of LGBTQ respondents from the same survey reported a negative impact on their neighborhood and community environment.
The effects of discrimination can be even more significant among LGBTQ individuals who are marginalized in other ways. For instance, LGBTQ people of color are 19 percent more likely than white LGBTQ individuals to face discrimination when applying for a job in the U.S.

Transgender and non-binary people of color report higher rates of suicidal thoughts and behaviors and are more likely to experience violence, poverty, and incarceration than their white counterparts.

Being a woman, identifying as non-binary, or being transgender also carries a higher chance of facing discrimination among those in the LGBTQ community.
</p><p>
Other factors that can contribute to the prevalence and types of discrimination faced by LGBTQ individuals include a person’s age, national origin, religion, disability status, and more.

LGBTQ Workplace Discrimination
Seventy-five countries across the globe, including the United States as of June 2020, prohibit employment discrimination on account of sexual orientation. In addition to the recently provided federal protections, a number of states, territories, counties, and municipalities have passed their own anti-discrimination laws. Some of them, such as Florida, are expressly intended to mirror federal laws providing for the same protections. So, until the Supreme Court issued its ruling in Bostock, gender identity and sexual orientation discrimination in the State of Florida were not prohibited, but they are now.

As of January 2020:

22 states and two U.S. territories have laws that prohibit workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation.
21 states and two U.S. territories prohibit workplace discrimination based on gender identity.
However, discrimination can also take several other forms. Employees may be discriminated against in their wages, how they are treated by their boss and coworkers, and in hiring practices.

Even more muddled are LGBTQ rights in situations of harassment in the workplace, such as offensive comments and other acts meant to make LGBTQ employees feel uncomfortable and unsafe. The legal standard that must be met in order to prove “workplace harassment” (also known as “hostile work environment”), the employee must be able to show that the offensive conduct was “so severe or pervasive that it materially altered the terms and conditions of the employment.” It is a relatively high standard that usually requires more than an isolated comment.
</p><p>
Medical Care Discrimination Against LGBTQ Individuals
Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals can encounter significant barriers in receiving accessible and inclusive health care and finding medical providers that are knowledgable about their needs.

Many LGBTQ people report delaying or avoiding seeking care because they’re concerned about how they may be treated by a provider. Bias and stigma in medical, employment, and other social settings can, in this way, not only have a significant mental and emotional toll, but also pose dangers to physical health and wellbeing.

There is no federal legislation in the United States that currently protects individuals from healthcare discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation.

On the contrary, in 2017 the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) began proposing regulations that would make it easier for medical providers to discriminate against LGBTQ patients, providing wider platitude to refuse care on moral or religious grounds.

In May of 2017, the HHS made moves to begin rolling back federal regulations that prohibit discrimination against transgender individuals who seek care through federally funded healthcare programs.
</p><p>
Examples of LGBTQ healthcare discrimination include:

refusal of care
promotion of inappropriate treatment interventions
use of abusive language by a medical provider
discrimination from fertility and sexual health specialists
A nationally representative 2017 survey from the Center for American Progress found that 8 percent of LGBTQ respondents reported delaying or forgoing medical care due to concerns about discrimination.

In the same survey, 8 percent of lesbian, gay, and bisexual respondents and 29 percent of transgender respondents reported experiencing a refusal of care from a medical provider because of their gender identity or sexual orientation in the past year.

Members of the LGBTQ community experience higher rates of mental and physical health problems compared to the general population. Thus, these barriers faced by LGBTQ individuals in healthcare settings pose a serious concern.

Discrimination Against LGBTQ Individuals In A Legal Setting
Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals can also face discrimination in legal settings.

With a lack of federal oversight, or even state-level protection in most areas of the country, there is little recourse available to LGBTQ people who face discrimination by lawyers, attorneys, and other legal professionals on account of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

Legal settings, as well as many public and private settings, can become abusive spaces for LGBTQ people, with individuals living in small or rural towns at heightened risk for mistreatment.

Discrimination Against LGBTQ Individuals In Social Settings
Discrimination can occur in a variety of settings, extending beyond just a person’s place of employment or their doctor’s office.

Social and public settings in the community can also become unsafe or unwelcoming for LGBTQ individuals, depending on the attitudes and beliefs expressed by those who occupy these spaces.

LGBTQ parents, children, teachers, and community workers can face exclusion and abuse from other people in their community through attempted participation in social activities, events, or education-based organizations.
</p><p>
It’s also legal in most states for businesses and other areas offering public accommodation to discriminate against LGBTQ individuals, as there is no federal law that explicitly prohibits this.

Individuals living in smaller towns that contain a reduced number of available business and service providers can face even greater costs from these discriminatory practices. This can affect where individuals are able to—or feel comfortable— buying their groceries, shopping for clothes, seeking auto repair, and engaging in other forms of consumer or social activity.

Laws Protecting LGBTQ Rights
Despite widespread concern and reports of discrimination targeting LGBTQ individuals, the options LGBTQ people have for legal recourse in situations of discrimination are limited.

Employment And Housing
Federal law prohibits discrimination based on sex, gender identity, and sexual orientation (among other things). Twenty-one states nationwide have passed state laws that explicitly prohibit employment and housing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. An additional state (Wisconsin) has a state law that prohibits discrimination due to sexual orientation only.
</p><p>
Employment discrimination is also prohibited in the U.S. territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia (D.C.). This does not extend to protection against housing discrimination in these territories.

Public Accommodation
Public accommodation non-discrimination laws protect the rights of LGBT people from being refused service or discriminated against in public places on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.

Nondiscrimination laws prohibiting this type of discrimination have been passed in 20 states and D.C. There are no laws explicitly prohibiting this type of discrimination in 27 states and five U.S. territories.

Credit
Fourteen states have state laws protecting the rights of LGBT people from being denied credit and lending services on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. There are no such laws passed in D.C. or any of the U.S territories.

                    Much has been achieved in terms of human rights for women and people of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual, and queer (LGBTQ) community. However, human resources management (HRM) initiatives for gender equality in the workplace focus almost exclusively on white, heterosexual, cisgender women, leaving the problems of other gender, and social minorities out of the analysis. This article develops an integrative model of gender equality in the workplace for HRM academics and practitioners. First, it analyzes relevant antecedents and consequences of gender-based discrimination and harassment (GBDH) in the workplace. Second, it incorporates the feminist, queer, and intersectional perspectives in the analysis. Third, it integrates literature findings about women and the LGBTQ at work, making the case for an inclusive HRM. The authors underscore the importance of industry-university collaboration and offer a starters' toolkit that includes suggestions for diagnosis, intervention, and applied research on GBDH. Finally, avenues for future research are identified to explore gendered practices that hinder the career development of women and the LGBTQ in the workplace.

             <center><h4> Introduction</h4></center>
                  <p> Gender has diversified itself. More than four decades have passed since Bem (1974) published her groundbreaking article on psychological androgyny. With her work, she challenged the binary conception of gender in the western academia, calling for the disposal of gender as a stable trait consistent of discrete categories (Mehta and Keener, 2017). Nowadays, people from the LGBTQ community find safe spaces to express their gender in most developed countries (see ILGA-Europe, 2017). Also, women-rights movements have impulsed changes for the emancipation and integration of women at every social level, enabling them to achieve things barely imaginable before (see Hooks, 2000).

                   However, there is still a lot to do to improve the situation of women and people from the LGBTQ community (International Labour Office, 2016; ILGA-Europe, 2017). Some actions to increase gender inclusion in organizations actually conceal inequality against women, and many problems faced by the LGBTQ originate within frameworks that anti-discrimination policy reinforce (see Benschop and Doorewaard, 1998, 2012; Verloo, 2006). For example, the gender equality, gender management, and gender mainstreaming approaches overlook most problems faced by people from the LGBTQ community and from women of color, framing their target stakeholders as white, cisgender, and heterosexual (see Tomic, 2011; Hanappi-Egger, 2013; Klein, 2016). These problems seem to originate in the neoliberalization of former radical movements when adopted by the mainstream (see Cho et al., 2013). This translates into actions addressing sexism and heterosexism that overlook other forms of discrimination (e.g., racism, ableism), resisting an intersectional approach that would question white, able-bodied, and other forms of privilege (see Crenshaw, 1991; Cho et al., 2013; Liasidou, 2013; van Amsterdam, 2013).
 
                   The purpose of this paper is to support the claim that gender equality shall be done within a queer, feminist, and intersectional framework. This argument is developed by integrating available evidence on the antecedents and consequences of GBDH against women and people from the LGBTQ community in the workplace. The authors believe that GBDH against these groups has its origin in the different manifestations of sexism in organizations. A model with the antecedents and consequences of GBDH in the workplace is proposed. It considers an inclusive definition of gender and integrates the queer-feminist approach to HRM (Gedro and Mizzi, 2014) with the intersectional perspective (Crenshaw, 1991; McCall, 2005; Verloo, 2006). In this way, it provides a framework for HRM scholars and practitioners working to counteract sexism, heterosexism, and other forms of discrimination in organizations.</p>

            <center><h4>GBDH in the Workplace</h4></center>
                  <p>GBDH is the umbrella term we propose to refer to the different manifestations of sexism and heterosexism in the workplace. The roots of GBDH are beyond the forms that discriminatory acts and behaviors take, being rather “about the power relations that are brought into play in the act of harassing” (Connell, 2006, p. 838). This requires acknowledging that gender harassment is a technology of sexism, that “perpetuates, enforces, and polices a set of gender roles that seek to feminize women and masculinize men” (Franke, 1997, p. 696). Harassment against the LGBTQ is rooted in a heterosexist ideology that establishes heterosexuality as the superior, valid, and natural form of expressing sexuality (see Wright and Wegner, 2012; Rabelo and Cortina, 2014). Furthermore, women and the LGBTQ are oppressed by the institutionalized sexism that underscores the supremacy of hegemonic masculinity (male, white, heterosexual, strong, objective, rational) over femininity (female, non-white, non-heterosexual, weak, emotional, irrational; Wright, 2013; Denissen and Saguy, 2014; Dougherty and Goldstein Hode, 2016). In addition, GBDH overlaps with other frameworks (e.g., racism, ableism, anti-fat discrimination) that concurrently work to maintain white, able-bodied, and thin privilege, impeding changes in the broader social structure (see Yoder, 1991; Yoder and Aniakudo, 1997; Buchanan and Ormerod, 2002; Acker, 2006; Liasidou, 2013; van Amsterdam, 2013). The next paragraphs offer a definition of some of the most studied forms of GBDH in the workplace.</p>

            <center><h4>Sexual Harassment</h4></center>
                <p> Sexual harassment was first defined in its different dimensions as gender harassment, unwanted sexual attention, and sexual coercion (Gelfand et al., 1995). Later, Leskinen and Cortina (2013) focused on the gender-harassment subcomponent of sexual harassment and developed a broadened taxonomy of the term. This was motivated by the fact that legal practices gave little importance to gender-harassment forms of sexual harassment, despite of the negative impact they have on the targets' well-being (Leskinen et al., 2011). Gender harassment consists of rejection or “put down” forms of sexual harassment such as sexist remarks, sexually crude/offensive behavior, infantilization, work/family policing, and gender policing (Leskinen and Cortina, 2013). The concepts of sexual harassment and gender harassment were initially developed to refer to the experiences of women in the workplace, but there is also evidence of sexual and gender harassment against LGBTQ individuals (Lombardi et al., 2002; Silverschanz et al., 2008; Denissen and Saguy, 2014). In addition, studies have shown how gender harassment and heterosexist harassment are complementary and frequently simultaneous phenomena accounting for mistreatment against members of the LGBTQ community (Rabelo and Cortina, 2014).</p>

            <center><h4>Gender Microaggressions</h4></center>
                 <p> Gender microaggressions account for GBDH against women and people from the LGBTQ community that presents itself in ways that are subtle and troublesome to notice (Basford et al., 2014; Galupo and Resnick, 2016). Following the taxonomy on racial microaggressions developed by Sue et al. (2007), the construct was adapted to account for gender-based forms of discrimination (Basford et al., 2014). Gender microaggressions consist of microassaults, microinsults, and microinvalidations, and although they may appear to be innocent, they exert considerably negative effects in the targets' well-being (Sue et al., 2007; Basford et al., 2014; Galupo and Resnick, 2016). As an example of microassault imagine an individual commenting their colleague that their way of dressing looks unprofessional (because it is not “masculine enough,” “too” feminine, or not according to traditional gender-binary standards). A microinsult is for example when the supervisor asks the subordinate about who helped them with their work (which was “too good” to be developed by the subordinate alone). An example of microinvalidation would be if in a corporate meeting the CEO dismisses information related to women or the LGBTQ in the company regarding it as unimportant, reinforcing the message that women and LGBTQ issues are inexistent or irrelevant (for more examples see Basford et al., 2014; Galupo and Resnick, 2016). Because gender is not explicitly addressed in microaggressions, it can be especially difficult for the victims to address the offense as such and act upon them (see Galupo and Resnick, 2016). Hence, they are not only emotionally distressing, but also tend to be highly ubiquitous, belonging to the daily expressions of a determined context (Nadal et al., 2011, 2014; Gartner and Sterzing, 2016).</p>

            <center><h4>Disguised Forms of GBDH</h4></center>
                   <p>It is also the case that some forms of workplace mistreatment constitute disguised forms of GBDH. Rospenda et al. (2008) found in their US study that women presented higher rates of generalized workplace abuse (i.e., workplace bullying or mobbing). In the UK, a representative study detected that a high proportion of lesbian, gay, and bisexual respondents have faced workplace bullying (Hoel et al., 2017). Specifically, the results indicated that while the bullying rate for heterosexuals over a six-months period was of 6.4%, this number was tripled for bisexuals (19.2%), and more than doubled for lesbians (16.9%) and gay (13.7%) individuals (Hoel et al., 2017). Moreover, 90% of the transgender sample in a US study reported experiencing “harassment, mistreatment or discrimination on the job” (Grant et al., 2011, p. 3). These findings suggest that many of the individuals facing workplace harassment that appears to be gender neutral are actually targets of GBDH. Hence, they experience “disguised gender-based harassment and discrimination” (Rospenda et al., 2009, p. 837) that should not be addressed as a gender-neutral issue.

                    Two years ago on this day, the Supreme Court had struck down the draconian Article 377 that criminalised gay sex. The same day Mr. Singh told his parents about his sexual orientation.

“I think having that in the back of my mind that even the apex court of the country believes I am not a criminal gave me the confidence to come out of the closet and explain my sexual orientation to my parents,” he said.
</p><p>
Two years on, Mr. Singh says he now considers that date as his second birthday when he was born again as an individual who was more free, confident and relaxed.


“It was the first step but I do think the time for the next step has come now. The inequality still blatantly exists in society’s mindset towards us whether it is in terms of inheritance laws or surrogacy laws - there is still a long, long road ahead of us,” Mr. Singh, the techie from Mumbai, said.

But Sunaina (name changed), an interior designer, says her life has not changed much since the verdict.

“The reason I can’t publicly identify myself is itself a proof that acceptance from society is difficult. I belong to a middle class family where even discussion over the subject of homosexuality is forbidden. Let alone coming out to my parents about being one. The verdict did good to us though. We are at least not considered criminals anymore but the mindset of the society is still the same,” she said.
</p>
<p>
The Supreme Court, in a landmark judgement on September 6, 2018, unanimously struck down part of the Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) which criminalised gay sex, saying that it violated the constitutional right to equality and dignity.

Section 377 declared “carnal intercourse against the order of nature” punishable by imprisonment for life.

The judgement was widely welcomed by most sections of society, especially the youth who called it a victory of love.

Both Singh and Sunaina say they remember celebrating that whole night two years ago even though they constantly were thinking about “what’s next?” Shubhankar Chakravorty, a Bengaluru-based writer, says the next move should be to extend the same civil rights to the LGBT population that the straight population enjoys.
</p>
<p>
“LGBT people are too taxpaying, law-abiding citizens, they have every right to the same privileges,” he said.

“Things have surely changed. LGBT people are now more confident to express themselves, grow personally, and own their relationships without the fear of discrimination and harassment. However, this change has primarily been for the urban, privileged few. Also, the lives of transgender people have not really improved much,” Mr. Chakravorty said.

Bittu Kondaiah, a trans-man, agrees with Chakravorty that the SC verdict did not do much for the transgender community.

“But it did ensure that there was one lesser section (of gay community) to get targeted by society. The midset that the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) community can be easily exploited as they have no one who cares about them, that mindset has changed,” he said.
</p>
<p>
Anjali Gopalan, a member of Naz Foundation, an NGO that has been at the forefront of the battle against Section 377, said the community has become a lot stronger since the verdict but there are more rights that it needs to be given.

“The LGBT community does not have any rights per say which society takes for granted like the right to marriage, inheritance so these are rights that should be there for everyone in society. Unfortunately, the LGBT community has been left out of it and that is something that needs to happen,” she said.

Tripti Tandon, lawyer and deputy director of Lawyers Collective, said it has been seen that the judgement gave many from the LGBT community the confidence to live their lives on their own terms.

“But unfortunately society still has not changed its mindset and that is the reason why the community members who take such steps of staying with their partners or moving away face a lot of violence and hostility and harassment from their parents,” Ms. Tandon, who was among the members of the team to fight the case in the apex court, said.
</p><p>
“The government needs to step in. The government really hasn’t done anything. If the government were to take some steps, then the message would go out very clearly in society that these relationships are not to be looked down upon,” she added.

Divya Dureja, a counselling psychologist and LGBTQIA+ wellness advocate, said there are still inadequacies in the “free and fair rights” of the LGBTQ community members.

“When will the state begin to recognise non-hetrosexual unions? How do we address the homelessness, bullying, violence, workplace discrimination still being faced by the members of the LGBTQ community and how can you give support to queer population drowning in mental health conditions,” she asked.

She said even though the gay community has found some respite from being targeted now that Section 377 has been struck down, crimes and harassment against trans folks and lesbians still continue under the present laws.

Akhila Sivadas, the managing trustee and executive director of the Centre for Advocacy and Research (CFAR), a non-profit organisation said while the significance of this ruling to decriminalise homosexuality cannot be reduced, the process of social inclusion and acceptance now assumes even greater importance.

                    Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender. Over the past decade, LGBT people have gained more and more tolerance and acceptance in India, especially in large cities.
Nonetheless, most LGBT people in India remain closeted, fearing discrimination from their families, who might see homosexuality as shameful. Discrimination is still present in rural areas, where LGBT people often face rejection from their families and forced opposite-sex marriages.</p>
<p>People in the LGBT community are fighting for equal rights and acceptance. Trans people, especially, face a lot of difficulty in finding acceptance. People in the LGBT community are looked down upon all the time. This is a major issue because discrimination against the LGBT community is highly prevalent.
People’s prejudices lead them to think that LGBT people are odd and very different. Today, homosexuality and queer identities may be acceptable to more Indian youths than ever before but within the boundaries of families, homes and schools, acceptance still remains a constant struggle for LGBT people. I have heard of people coming out of the closet and declaring to their families that they are not the person their family expected them to be.
Being L,G,B or T is not a ‘problem’, nor is it a ‘choice’ as such. LGBT individuals are merely individuals who have sexual preferences that differ from what would appear to be the ‘norm’, due to differing learned behaviours and, you know, having a personal perspective and mindset that differs from everyone else’s. Saying that it’s objectively wrong for people to have sexual preferences that differ from the norm is objectively wrong itself.
</p><p>Article 15 of our Indian Constitution Article 15, 1949
15. Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, Sex or place of birth.
If normal men and women have the right to live in this society with respect then why not a person who belongs to LGBT can live in this society with respect. It’s not about what our religion says it’s about what humanity says…If we talk about religion as per the Hindu aspects Lord Rama had given a boon to hijras for their loyalty that’s why the curse or boon of hijras means a lot to the normal beings.I think everyone who is living in this world, either normal or abnormal has equal rights to live in this society with full respect..!!
