                  <h3><br>“Confidence is the stuff that turns thoughts into action” 
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                   After unexpectedly taking six years out of the workforce to raise my two daughters, I suffered from acute anxiety when I later returned to professional life. Despite having kept my skills current by completing a second degree and researching and publishing, A World of Difference, I suffered a paralysing confidence gap when I launched my consultancy in 2012.
To cope with the anxiety, I managed my work schedule carefully so that I had sufficient space to manage my emotions on top of my workload. But I knew that operating in a state of fear was not sustainable. First, anxiety was preventing me from performing at my best. Second, emotional and physical exhaustion was limiting the number of assignments I could take on. Third, my health was suffering. I either had to give up or conquer the fear. After investing four years at university and three years researching and writing, A World of Difference, giving up was not an option. Instead, I researched and experimented with a number of evidence-based solutions for developing self-confidence. Applying those techniques, I was able to overcome the anxiety and self-limiting beliefs that had been holding me back.</p><p>
In this blog, I share the proven approaches for developing self-confidence that helped me move from ‘rabbit in the headlights’ to ‘feel the fear and do it anyway’. I hope by sharing these techniques, I can empower others who are suffering from self-doubt to achieve their full potential.
TECHNIQUES FOR DEVELOPING SELF-CONFIDENCE
Individuals with high levels of confidence have both (a) high self-efficacy and (b) low fear of failure. Self-efficacy is one’s belief in their ability to succeed and involves a positive assessment of one’s capabilities. Low fear of failure is linked to a propensity for stepping outside one’s comfort zone. Techniques for developing self-confidence address either self-efficacy, fear of failure, or both.
Challenging Self-Limiting Beliefs
Women, in particular, often have a number of self-limiting beliefs that prevent them from taking steps forward. Girls emerge from adolescence with a poor self-image, relatively low expectations from life and much less confidence in themselves and their abilities than boys, To make progress on confidence, we need to challenge negative self-narratives (e.g. ‘I am not good enough / smart enough / pretty enough) and replace with more compassionate and optimistic self-talk.</p><p>
There are three steps to challenging your self-limiting beliefs and rewiring your inner narrative:
Identify your self-limiting beliefs. Some of you might be already consciously aware of your inner doubts and fears. Some of you might need to spend some time digging deeper to identify the thoughts that are holding you back from taking action. A good way to pinpoint your self-limiting beliefs is to monitor your emotional triggers. If there are particular situations that make you feel anxious or afraid, take some time to reflect on what beliefs are driving those emotions. Being mindful of your inner narrative over the course of a workday can help you to articulate your self-limiting beliefs. Notice whether and when you downplay your achievements or if you attribute your successes to others or luck. Notice also any comparisons you make of yourself to others. Comparisons are typically biased—we notice the outward successes of others but fail to see their internal struggles, insecurities, and limitations. We focus on our own imperfections and fail to recognise our achievements.
Challenge your self-limiting beliefs. Once you have identified your self-limiting beliefs – whether in the form of self-doubts, downplaying our achievements, or negatively comparing ourselves to others—we must challenge those beliefs by searching for evidence that contradicts them. Find the counter-argument to your self-limiting belief. If you find this hard to do, try distancing yourself from your self-limiting belief by imagining that you are coaching a friend on how to challenge their self-limiting belief. How would you talk them out of that negative self-talk and convince them otherwise? Then apply that advice to your own situation.
Change the narrative. The third step is to replace your self-limiting beliefs with a more rational, reasonable and optimistic narrative.<br><br>

                    In December of 1920, Amelia Earhart paid to go on her first plane ride. The experience lasted only ten minutes, but it changed the direction of her life: Amelia was determined to be a pilot. It didn’t matter to her that there were only a few women in the field of aviation. Through hard work and challenging conditions, she developed her skills. While other female pilots feared the long journey across the Transatlantic, Amelia’s gutsy determination led her to be first woman to fly it solo. The confidence she possessed was one of her greatest strengths and led her to set many  records.

Amelia Earhart was not the only highly competent female pilot during that time in history. Although she was skilled, I don’t believe that is what caused her to be so successful. Rather it was her confidence, her willingness to go after the impossible, and her belief that she could do it. At Zenger Folkman we’ve found that confidence proves to be equally as valuable as competence because it leads to action, attention, and resilience—all traits exemplified during Amelia’s transatlantic flight.

Amelia Earhart’s accomplishments were especially noteworthy at the time, because of her achievements in what had been a male domain.  Aviators were nearly all men. Gender differences in confidence are quite dramatic.  A study done at Cornell University found that men overestimate their abilities and performance, while women underestimate both. In fact, their actual performance does not differ in quality or quantity.

PROMOTED</p><p>




This female confidence challenge was also described as the “imposter syndrome” by Pauline Claunce and  Suzanne Imes. Women frequently express that they don’t feel they deserve their job and are “imposters” who could be found out at any moment.  They found that women worry more about being disliked, appearing unattractive, outshining others, or grabbing too much attention.


Men are not exempt from doubting themselves—but they don’t let their doubts stop them as often as women do.  A Hewlett Packard internal report found that men apply for a job or promotion when they meet only 60% of the qualifications, but women apply only if they meet 100% of them. What doomed them was not their actual ability, but rather the decision not to try.

Zenger Folkman's research shows that as women’s experience increases over time, so does their confidence. The graph below shows that women’s confidence increases more with age than men’s. But consider the many opportunities lost in early years because of fear and lack of confidence.

Building self-confidence
I wish there were definitive steps to build self-confidence and self-esteem, but I don’t think they exist. However, there are a number of things you can do that appear to be related to higher levels of confidence and self-esteem.

Mindset: It has been said that self-confidence is what you think about yourself, and self-esteem is what you think others think of you. To build self-confidence:
Focus on the strengths you possess and your achievements, rather than what you don’t do well. Guard carefully against negative self-talk.
Radiate optimism and general happiness. They bring life and vitality into conversations. Your outward behavior changes your inner feelings.
People are attracted to those who are perceived as “warm” and shy away from those who are perceived as “cold.” The self-confident person is usually described as being warm.
Dress and grooming: These are immediate and tangible signals to others about how you feel about yourself. Beyond that, they have been shown to make a difference in how someone feels about themselves. Bottom line, people feel more confident when they know they look nice.
Posture: Your posture has a strong impact on what you’re feeling inside.
Stand tall. Research has shown that when someone stands tall in a position of strength, their inner feelings begin to change.
Make and maintain eye contact with others. This conveys interest in others and confidence in yourself.
Facial expressions communicate important messages and need to be consistent with words being said. Some estimate that at least 80% of communication comes non-verbally, and facial expression conveys a great deal of information.
Overall manner: How you behave will transmit a feeling of confidence to others. Confident people:
Walk briskly, conveying that they have somewhere important to go and something important to do.
Laugh with others and cause them to laugh. This does not necessarily come from telling jokes, but usually comes from pleasant banter regarding topics of mutual interest.</p><p>
Speak up in meetings. They don’t sit quietly through discussions, but are an active participant.
Interact with many people when put into a large gathering rather than confining themselves to long conversations with two or three for an entire evening.
Initiate contact with others, not waiting for others to come to them. Confident people extend themselves to a much larger number of people than their less-confident counterparts.
Speech: What you say and how you say it transmits a great deal about your level of confidence. It also shapes how you feel about yourself. Confident people:
Project their voice, making them easily heard and understood.
Vary the pitch and tone of their voice. They make their conversation interesting by avoiding monotones and injecting variety.
Pause for emphasis—they are not afraid of moments of silence. Not filling every pause further conveys personal feelings of self-worth and confidence. Sometimes these pauses are used to gather time to think, take a deep breath, or refocus a discussion.
Use a rich vocabulary, enabling them to be vivid and pre They continue to develop a strong vocabulary, not to impress, but to help ideas come to life. Colorful, visceral words make their communication memorable.</p><p>
They avoid “non-words,” such as “er,” “umm,” and filler-phrases such as “you know."
Communication practices: Confident individuals use communication practices that convey certainty with others while also making them feel more confident within themselves. For example, they:
Frequently ask questions of others, showing intense interest in what others say and in what they are doing.
Use metaphors, examples, and stories liberally. Communication comes alive with illustrations that make the abstract more concrete and theoretical ideas easily understood.
Use humor to make important points.
Confident people are often masters of self-deprecating humor. People of stature and accomplishment are the ones most willing to poke fun at themselves.
Express ideas respectfully, never with unnecessary confrontation. If their ideas differ from others, this is more likely to be expressed as, “I see this a little differently,” or, “Help me to understand your reasons for thinking…”
Amelia Earhart had the guts and gumption to take every opportunity even when she was unsure if she was competent enough to do it. No one knows everything, and most people—male and female—have moments of feeling they are imposters trying to prove their competence and worth. The good news is that for women and men, confidence keeps increasing over time.

                  <h3>Create an Environment That Helps You Feel Good</h3>
                  <p>
                    Feeling bad about yourself can hold you back in life. Fortunately, there are several things you can do to improve your self-esteem.


When we believe something, we constantly look for evidence (and create more evidence) that our belief is true. So if you believe you’re unworthy, you’ll view every mistake, mishap, and rejection as proof that you’re not good enough. 

When you succeed at something (like you get an award), you’ll likely chalk it up to “good luck” rather than take credit for your effort or skills. You also might unintentionally create an environment that reinforces your low self-esteem.


A 2018 study found that people with low self-esteem tend to surround themselves with people who put them down. 1﻿﻿﻿﻿ When others put them down, their words are in line with what the individual with low self-esteem thinks about themselves. And it gives the individual a twisted sense of comfort as they believe, “You see me the same way I see me.”
</p><p>

Additionally, the study found that individuals who don’t feel good about themselves are more likely to seek support with indirect methods, like whining, sulking, and complaining. Those strategies increase the likelihood that others will respond poorly, which again reinforces their beliefs that no one cares and they aren’t good enough.

So clearly, it’s important to evaluate the people around you. Are you surrounding yourself with people who subtly put you down? Take a look at the physical environment too. Do you live in a cluttered, crowded space? Perhaps a messy place reinforces to you that you aren’t worthy of living in a neat environment.

Changing your environment can make a big difference in how you feel about yourself.

So make it a priority to surround yourself with people and things who send a message that says you are good enough. It will feel uncomfortable at first but as your self-esteem improves, it’ll get easier.
</p>
<h3>Talk to Yourself Like a Trusted Friend</h3>
<p>
Monitor the conversations you have with yourself. If you repeatedly tell yourself, “This will never work,” or “Everyone is going to laugh at me,” you’re going to feel bad about yourself.

When you catch yourself being overly critical or making negative predictions about your chances of success, stop and ask, “What would I say to a friend who was thinking this?” Chances are, you’d likely to offer some compassionate words of encouragement. For some reason, it’s much easier to be kind to others than it is ourselves.

But self-compassion can be key to helping you feel better about yourself. Speak back to those negative thoughts with a kinder, more compassionate statement, like “You can do this! Do your best and look people in the eye!” Changing your inner dialogue can shift your mindset over time so your brain will begin to recognize that you’re more capable and competent than you give yourself credit for.
</p>
<h3>Act as If You Feel Confident</h3> <p>
Changing the way you think isn’t always enough to change your deep-rooted beliefs and feelings about yourself, however. It’s also important to change your behavior. A common therapy strategy is to “act as if.” So in your case, it would be to “act as if you felt confident.” 

Ask yourself, “What would a confident person do right now?” It might be as simple as shaking hands, introducing yourself, or volunteering to go first. 

When you take action first, your feelings often follow. Acting confident shifts your mindset and can help you feel more confident about yourself. 

Make sure you’re doing things that help you feel good in the big picture, too. Try new things, meet different people, and challenge yourself in healthy ways. And remind yourself, you don’t have to wait until you feel confident to get out there and do it. 

Get Help If You Need It
If you’re struggling to create changes on your own, talk to a therapist. A mental health professional can help you address the factors that affect your self-esteem so you can feel better. And feeling good about yourself is the key to reaching your greatest potential and living your best life.

In a culture saturated with digitally altered images of impossibly thin women, raising girls with high self-esteem can be daunting indeed. But as parents, you have great influence—both by what you say and what you do. Here’s some advice from experts Catherine Steiner-Adair, EdD, a clinical psychologist, school consultant and creator of the “Full of Ourselves,” a social-emotional program for girls, Anea Bogue, MA, author (9 Ways We Are Screwing Up Our Girls and How We Can Stop),and the creator of REALgirl, an empowerment program for girls, and Mary Rooney, PhD, a clinical psychologist who specializes in adolescents.
</p><p>
1. Model body acceptance. Moms have a huge impact on their daughters’ body image. Don’t ask, “Do these jeans make me look fat?” or obsess out loud about food or put your appearance down. Avoid what Dr. Steiner-Adair calls the “morality of orality”—talking about food and yourself as “good” or “bad.” As in: I was bad today: I had pizza. So I’m not going to have dessert.
</p><p>
2. Make your daughter media literate. “Watch TV with her and talk about what you see,” says Dr. Steiner-Adair. “Help her develop a critical eye through which to decode and filter media messages.”
</p><p>
3. Don’t raise her as a “pleaser.” Encourage her to stand up for what she needs and wants. “Create opportunities for her to use her voice,” Bogue advises. “Ask ‘What do you want?’ Let her make a choice and then honor that choice.”

4. Start team sports early. Research shows girls who play on teams have higher self-esteem. “There’s a very common correlation, in my experience,” says Bogue, “between girls who play team sports and girls who suffer less with low self-esteem because they are looking to other girls for their value, and within, as opposed to looking to boys for validation.”
</p><p>
5. Moms, don’t borrow your daughter’s clothes. “You want to let her have her own style, her own look,” says Dr. Steiner-Adair. “Especially, and this is a really hard thing, if you have a mom who by society’s standards is prettier or thinner than her daughter.”
</p><p>
6. Direct your praise away from appearance. “I think that we need to make a very conscious effort to balance our compliments about a girl’s appearance with compliments about who she is and what she DOES in the world,” says Bogue. “Challenge yourself to match every compliment you give about your daughter’s appearance with at least two compliments about something non-appearance based, and do the same for other girls who cross your path — your daughter’s friends, nieces, etc.”
</p><p>
7. Help her build skills that are independent of appearance. “Get her involved in activities that build a sense of confidence, rather than focusing on looking good and acquiring things,” Dr. Rooney suggests. “Sports, theater, music, art. Anything really that can help girls express themselves through words or creativity or activity rather than through their appearance or what they’re carrying around.”
</p><p>
8. Speak up about your daughter’s school curriculum. Does it include a female perspective? “Imagine if you were putting together a family history,” Bogue says, “and you only asked the men about their memories, about their perspective. Think about all of the information that would be lost.”
</p><p>
9. Praise your daughter for her efforts rather than her performance.“Focus less on the outcome and more on efforts and the development of new skills,” says Dr. Rooney. Mastery is what builds confidence, and learning to tolerate failure fosters resilience.
</p><p>
10. Be careful about what magazines you have in the house. “Research suggests,” says Steiner-Adair, “that after 15 minutes of looking at a fashion magazine, mood shifts from curiosity and enthusiasm to comparing yourself and putting yourself down.”
</p><p>
11. Don’t trash talk other women. “And don’t let the boys and men in your household do it either,” adds Dr. Steiner-Adair. “Don’t let kids tease each other around food or looks. Do not let that go down in your house. It’s really harmful.”
</p><p>
12. Dads: Don’t treat your daughter like a damsel in distress.“When fathers treat girls as though they are these fragile, helpless, little beings, ” Bogue says, “the message is, ‘Your role is to look good so a man will sweep in and save you.’ Instead, give her the opportunity and the tools—to change her own tire, to use her voice and speak up for herself, to play sports, to be able to brush herself off and get back up. I think it’s a good measure to say, ‘If I would do it with my son, I should be prepared to do it with my daughter.'”
</p><p>
13. Make sure she knows you love her no matter what. She needs to know that you’ll love her “no matter how her appearance might change or how she dresses or how she might perform at something,” says Dr. Rooney. “Because even though kids are so reliant on their peers for feedback when they’re in their teens, what her parents think of her matters just as much as it ever did.”
